                                    The Aperol Spritz has an unmistakable orange and fresh bittersweet taste which will light up your toasts and add extra joy to the moment. So where did the cocktail originate?

                                    Moscow mules are delightfully fizzy drinks made with fiery ginger beer, vodka and fresh lime. They are refreshing on hot summer days, but they're also holiday-appropriate thanks to the strong ginger flavor.

                                <p>
                                    Aperol finally entered the picture in the early 1900s, when brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbier inherited their father's liquor company in 1912, and after seven years of experimentation, debuted the bold, technicolor tipple Aperol, inspired by the French term for apéritif: "Apéro." The original recipe, which is still in use today, remains a secret, but does include both bitter and sweet oranges as well as rhubarb.

                                <p>
                                    As cocktails became a social badge of honour during the Shakespearean times, developments into the mood-altering effects of booze turned mixing drinks and bartending into big news.
